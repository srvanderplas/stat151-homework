## Steam Games

This week's homework data is from TidyTuesday, an organization that provides datasets every Tuesday for people to practice their data tidying and manipulation skills. See the [readme](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/readme.md) for more information.

**Data Dictionary**

|variable      |class     |description |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
|gamename      |character | Name of video games |
|year          |double    | Year of measure |
|month         |character | Month of measure |
|avg           |double    | Average number of players at the same time|
|gain          |double    | Gain (or loss) Difference in average compared to the previous month (NA = 1st month) |
|peak          |double    | Highest number of players at the same time |
|avg_peak_perc |character | Share of the average in the maximum value (avg / peak) in % |

```{r steam-games-data-setup}
games <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/games.csv')

library(ggplot2) # load ggplot2 package
```

### R: Replicate the plot

Your first goal (in R) is to get to this graph by breaking down the problem (replicating the graph) into smaller steps that make sense and that you can accomplish piece-by-piece.

Useful hints:

1. `month.name` is a vector containing month names that you can use to create a factor variable. Factor variables can be easily converted into numeric variables. This might help you get a numeric month, which might help you get to a fractional year.

2. `subset()` is a function that will subset a data frame based on a logical condition. It might be easier to use than logical indexing (though you can use either)

3. To get a line graph in ggplot2, use `geom_line()`. Using `aes(color = varname)` will color the lines by variable name.

4. Some sample code to make a line graph in ggplot is provided below:

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(dplyr)
# Get only january months so that there's one point a year
jan_data <- filter(games, month == "January")

# x axis is year, y axis is average players
# group = gamename says draw one line for each game
ggplot(data = jan_data, 
       aes(x = year, y = avg, group = gamename)) + 
  geom_line()
```


#### Problem Steps

Make a list of steps that will be necessary to get the data you have into this form.





#### Problem Code
Provide code that sequentially works through your list of steps to produce the graph.

```{r}
# Code for step 1 goes here

```
