## Pythagorean Theorem in R

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Use the chunk below to define variables $a$, $b$, and $c$, where you set $a$ and $b$ and $c$ is determined mathematically. You may need to find the square root function in R to make this work.

```{r pythagorean-theorem-r}

```


## Quadratic Formula in Python

$$x = -b \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$


Use the chunk below to define variables $a$, $b$, and $c$, and then define $x1$ and $x2$, the possible values for $x$.

```{python quad-formula-py}

```



## Debugging practice

Look at the data frame below, which contains 3 columns: `Name`, `Salary`, and `Hire.Year`. You've read in this data from the 


```{r}
salary <- read.table("3-data.tsv", sep = "\t", header = T)

salary
```
