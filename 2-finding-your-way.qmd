## MadLibs
### Running a Python Script at the command line

Run the script [madlibs.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/stat151-homework/main/madlibs.py) at the command line. Do what it asks of you, and then paste the output here, making use of the generic (no language) markdown code chunk below.

```

```

Can you run this same script in RStudio using the Source Script button? If you can, please describe any differences you note compared to using the terminal. If you cannot, tell me what happens.


## Thinking Critically

Consider the 3 counting words examples in the [textbook module](https://srvanderplas.github.io/Stat151/finding-your-way.html#example-counting-words-in-r-within-rstudio). Look at the code, and then at the information provided for each example. What is different? What is the same? Write 2-3 sentences describing how RStudio script mode, interactive mode, and command-line mode differ.
